# 📽 Movie Recommendation System
🚀 A personalized movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques and the TMDB dataset.

## 📌 Overview
In today's digital era, the sheer number of available movies makes it difficult for users to find content that suits their preferences. This Movie Recommendation System leverages content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user interests.

The system uses the TMDB dataset, which contains extensive details about movies, including cast, crew, genres, and revenue, to enhance recommendation accuracy.
🔍 Features
✅ Personalized Recommendations – Suggests movies based on content similarity and user preferences.
✅ Machine Learning Algorithms – Uses content-based filtering to analyze movie metadata.
✅ Data Processing & Cleaning – Works with real-world datasets, handling missing or inaccurate data.
✅ Interactive User Interface (Optional) – Can be extended with a front-end for a better user experience.
✅ Scalable & Efficient – Designed to handle large movie datasets.

## 📂 Dataset
The system utilizes the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits dataset, which includes:

Movie metadata – Title, genres, overview, release date, etc.
Cast & Crew information
Revenue & Popularity metrics
Source: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries Used:
Pandas 🏷️ (Data processing)
NumPy 🔢 (Numerical operations)
Scikit-learn 🤖 (Machine learning)
NLTK 📝 (Natural Language Processing for text-based filtering)

# 📊 How It Works
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean the dataset
Handle missing values
Extract relevant movie features
2️⃣ Feature Engineering:

Use TF-IDF vectorization to process movie descriptions
Compute cosine similarity to find related movies
3️⃣ Recommendation Algorithm:

When a user searches for a movie, the system finds the most similar movies using content-based filtering
